This repository is meant to hold and display all of the miscellaneous major projects that I have written and more or less completed over the course of my computer science education since Spring 2014. These projects are kept here because they don't have much application outside of the classes they were written for and are here to serve as a personal reference and improve on future development by seeing past programming habits, flaws, or mistakes.

This repository includes the following projects with their respective course and languages involved in writing them. 

-"Battleship" | System & Network Programming [CSCI 3342] | Java
